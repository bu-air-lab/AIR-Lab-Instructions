> AIR Lab has several robotic platforms and this page will guide you how to operate them. 

## Robotic Platforms
* [Turtlebot](#turtlebot)
* [Segbot](#segbot)
* [UR5e Robotic Arm](#ur5e robotic arm)

## Turtlebot
AIR Lab has a team of 8 Turtlebot-2 robots. This [page](https://github.com/vkudalk1/AIR-Lab-Instructions/blob/master/Turtlebot.md) shows the instructions to run the Turtlebot.

## Segbot
The lab also have a Segway-based mobile robot platform (RMP-110). The following [page](https://github.com/vkudalk1/AIR-Lab-Instructions/blob/master/Segbot.md) shows the instructions to run the Segbot.


## UR5e Robotic Arm
The lab also has a collaborative robot arm from Universal Robots with a two-finger gripper and 6-DOF. This [page](https://github.com/vkudalk1/AIR-Lab-Instructions/blob/master/UR5e.md) shows the instructions to run the UR5e robotic arm.
