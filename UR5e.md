# UR5e instructions
> The page shows the instructions to operate UR5e platform.

If this is your first time, please check the [Wiki page](https://github.com/bu-air-lab/UR5e_arm/wiki) of this repository to learn how to work with the arm.

## To start the UR5e?
* Turn on the robot using the above wiki page.
* Turn on the machine connected to the UR5e arm.
* Make sure the USB from the UR5e is connected to the machine.
* Also make sure you have the IP of the robotic arm. See the above [Wiki page](https://github.com/bu-air-lab/UR5e_arm/wiki) to find the IP of the arm.
* Sign in to your account on the machine. If you do not have your account created, contact the lab administrator.

## Running the robotic arm for the first time.
Before running the robot, you need to run the following commands.

Now, go ahead and install the libraries below:
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit && sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers && sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-industrial-msgs && rosdep install robotiq_modbus_tcp && sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-soem` <br />
```
Create a catkin workspace by running the commands below: <br />
```
$ mkdir â€“p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd catkin_ws
$ wstool init src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bu-air-lab/AIR-Lab-Instructions/master/rosinstall/ur5e_kinetic.rosinstall
```
Now compile: <br />
``` 
$ catkin_make
```
If there are no errors, the source the workspace and run the bringup: <br />
```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch ur_modern_driver ur5e_bringup.launch robot_ip:=IP_OF_ROBOT
```
The robot can go move to hard-coded points:<br />
```
$ rosrun ur_modern_driver test_move.py
```
Also, using RVIZ, you can give goals to the arm. To do that, open up a new terminal and:<br />
```
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch ur5_e_moveit_config ur5_e_moveit_planning_execution.launch
```

and in another terminal:<br />
```
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch ur5_e_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true
```
To work with the gripper:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER 
$ dmesg | grep tty 
$ sudo chmod 777  /dev/ttyACM0 
$ rosrun robotiq_2f_gripper_control Robotiq2FGripperRtuNode.py /dev/ttyACM0 `
```
And in a new terminal:
```
rosrun robotiq_2f_gripper_control Robotiq2FGripperSimpleController.py 
```

Once you are done working, please turn off the arm.
